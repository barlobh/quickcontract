This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Stripe payment links

Set your Stripe Payment Links as public env vars before building/deploying:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_LINK_PER_CONTRACT=https://buy.stripe.com/your-per-contract-link
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_LINK_LIFETIME=https://buy.stripe.com/your-lifetime-link
```

These power the pricing buttons on the landing page. On Vercel, add them in Project Settings → Environment Variables (Production + Preview).
